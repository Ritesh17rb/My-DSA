## "DSA Complete Preparation" 

DSA Complete Preparation
Overview
This repository is dedicated to comprehensive preparation for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. It is designed to assist learners in mastering the essential concepts of DSA and understanding the associated time complexities. Whether you are a beginner or looking to reinforce your DSA skills, this resource aims to provide clarity and practical insights.

Key Features
Algorithm Implementations: Find detailed implementations of various algorithms commonly encountered in DSA, including sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.

Data Structure Implementations: Explore practical implementations of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and more.

Time Complexity Analysis: Each algorithm is accompanied by a thorough analysis of its time complexity. Understand the efficiency of the algorithms and make informed decisions when choosing the right one for your application.

Important Time Complexities (in C++)
Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort:

Worst Case: O(n^2)
Best Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Merge Sort:

Worst Case: O(n log n)
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Quick Sort:

Worst Case: O(n^2)
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Searching Algorithms
Linear Search:

Worst Case: O(n)
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case: O(n)
Binary Search:

Worst Case: O(log n)

Graph Algorithms
Breadth-First Search (BFS):

Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
Depth-First Search (DFS):

Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
